Steps to lower noise floor in direct simulated images from Kevin for preparing pyLINEAR sims:
(Steps before running pyLINEAR to simulate and extract).

Why is it needed?
If the background is kept at exactly zero then SExtractor (in step ... below)
detects WAY more fake sources (about 2x more). So adding an artificial background,
after the pre-existing background is removed, imposes a limit on the faintest 
magnitude source that can be detected at some set threshold above the background.

---------------------------------------------------
1. Correct direct image from Kevin to bring it to the correct WFC3/F105W zeropoint.
2. Run first pass of SExtractor on image from above step -- using a fairly low threshold (2-sigma)?
3. Using segmap from above step force all pix not associated with a source to be exactly zero.
4. Add a low non-zero background. This is simply a Gaussian with mean of 0.0 and some small sigma.
5. Insert fake SNe with correct counts.
6. Run second pass of SExtractor -- this time with a threshold of at least 3.
7. Assign a spectrum to each source.
8. Run final checks on inserted SNe magnitudes, mag distribution, and redshifts.
